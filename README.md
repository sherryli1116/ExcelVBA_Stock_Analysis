# An Analysis of Stock Market Dataset Using Excel VBA

## Overview of Project
Steve, who we worked together with us in the previous modules want to do a little more research for his parents. He wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Therefore, we want to create a logistic structured code in order to help him calculate the information he needs from the stock market dataset in an efficient way. We first setted the tickerindex to zero before looping over the rows and also created arrays for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices. The tickerindex is used to access the stock ticker index for the arrays we created in the previous step. The script loops through the data set and storing values from the tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices. Last, we changed the color of the formatting cells, by making positive returns green and negative returns red. 
### Purpose
In this project, we are using VBA code in Excel to loop through the VBA Challenge Stock Dataset in order to collect useful information from this dataset. We want to make the code we created efficient for others to use in analyzing the data set. 
## Results
By comparing the 2017 and the 2018 stocks, the difference in the total daily volume between the two years that resulted in less than a $100,000,000 in increased volume was not enough to generate a positive 2018 return percentage. The tickers ENPH and RUN had would have been considered good investments due to the positive returns in 2018, and both of the tickers had increases greater than $200,000,000 over the 2017 total daily volumes.
## Summary
### Detail Analysis of Our Result
#### Advantages:
* When creating the nested conditional and for loops in VBA, logic errors are easily to detect. The debugging function highlighted the exactly place we need to modify. 
* 
#### Disadvantages:
* The structure is easily affected by a small typo or indenx mistake, we need to double check in order to make sure there is no small mistakes affecting the code we produced.
* 
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
